# team5 HP Milestone 3

Denny<br>
Navbar<br>
*make search bar take you somewhere*<br>
Homepage<br>
Footer<br>

Calvin<br>
Deliverer main menu<br>
*Practice reusable components. So pass all details that would differ between users as a parameter/prop*<br>
 - no performance or review or list of completed orders needed
 - There is instead only an int of how many orders this deliverer completed. So show this somehow but with a made up number for now<br>

John<br>
Restaurant page for customers<br>
*this is not in the mockup, but we need it*<br>
*This one is fine if you make just one page with hard coded values. The real one would probably make a queryto our API after being passed a restaurant id as a parameter but we don’t have an API yet.*<br>
 - Once a customer clicks a restaurant they see this and the restaurant’s menu
 - People are able to click a button to add food to cart (we don’t have a cart for now so make this button do nothing)<br>

Huan<br>
*These will all look similar. Once a person clicks submit just make that button do nothing right now.*<br>
User, Restaurant, Deliverer Sign up<br>
User, Restaurant, Deliverer Log in<br>

Marco<br>
*Practice reusable components: A good one to use here is a reusable order card thing and you pass it the details over props in react which are basically parameters*<br>
*Have one of each page. The reusable component here would be those cards with the order details. We don’t have a way to login right now so we can’t have different pages for each user yet.*<br>
Restaurant order page<br>
Delivery order page<br>
